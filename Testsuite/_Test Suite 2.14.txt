C64 Emulator Test Suite - Public Domain, no Copyright

The purpose of the C64 Emulator Test Suite is to
- help C64 emulator authors improve their compatibility
- ensure that update versions have no new bugs in old code parts

The suite are a few hundred C64 programs which check the details of the C64 they are running on. The suite runs automated and stops only if it has detected an error. That the suite doesn't stop on my C64-I/PAL proves that the suite has no bugs. That the same suite doesn't stop on an emulator proves that this particular emulator is compatible to my C64 regarding every tested detail. Of course, the emulator may still have bugs in parts which are not tested by the suite. There may also be a difference between your C64 and my C64.

While the Test Suite is running, the datasette should be disconnected.



Program _START - some 6510 basic commands, just as an insurance



Programs LDAb to SBCb(EB) - 6510 command function

addressing modes
-----------------------------------
n   none (implied and accu)
b   byte (immediate)
w   word (absolute for JMP and JSR)
z   zero page
zx  zero page,x
zy  zero page,y
a   absolute
ax  absolute,x
ay  absolute,y
i   indirect (JMP)
ix  (indirect,x)
iy  (indirect),y
r   relative

Display:
before  data  accu xreg yreg  flags  sp
after   data  accu xreg yreg  flags  sp
right   data  accu xreg yreg  flags  sp

Either press STOP or any other key to continue.

All 256 opcodes are tested except HLTn (02 12 22 32 42 52 62 72 92 B2 D2 F2).

Indexed addressing modes count the index registers from 00 to FF.

JMPi (xxFF) is tested.

Single operand commands: 256 data combinations from 00 to FF multiplied by 256 flag combinations.

Two operand commands: 256 data combinations 00/00, 00/11, ... FF/EE, FF/FF multiplied by 256 flag combinations.

ANEb, LASay, SHAay, SHAiy, SHXay, SHYax and SHSay are executed only in the y border. These commands cause unpredictable results when a DMA comes between the command byte and the operand.

SHAay, SHAiy, SHXay, SHYax and SHSay are tested on a data address xxFF only. When the hibyte of the indexed address needs adjustment, these commands will write to different locations, depending on the data written.



Programs TRAP* - 6510 IO traps, page boundaries and wrap arounds

 #  code  data  zd  zptr   aspect tested

14  2800  0000  F7  F7/F8  64k wrap around plus IO trap
15  CFFF  D0C6  00  FF/00  1-14 all together as a stress test
16  FFFE  ----  --  --/--  64k boundary within 3 byte commands
17  FFFF  ----  --  --/--  64k boundary within 2 and 3 byte commands

In the programs TRAP16 and TRAP17, the locations of data, zerodata and zeroptr depend on the addressing mode. The CPU port at 00/01 is not able to hold all 256 bit combinations.

The datasette may not be connected while TRAP16 and TRAP17 are running!

Display:
after   data  accu xreg yreg  flags
right   data  accu xreg yreg  flags

If all displayed values match, some other aspect is wrong, e.g. the stack pointer or data on stack.

All 256 commands are tested except HLTn. Registers before:
data   1B (00 01 10 11)
accu   C6 (11 00 01 10)
xreg   B1 (10 11 00 01)
yreg   6C (01 10 11 00)
flags  00
sptr   not initialized, typical F8

The code length is 6 bytes maximum (SHSay).

When the lowbyte of the data address is less than C0, SHAay, SHAiy, SHXay, SHYax and SHSay aren't tested. Those commands don't handle the address adjustment correctly.

Relative jumps are tested in 4 combinations: offset 01 no jump, offset 01 jump, offset 80 no jump, offset 80 jump. For the offset 80, a RTS is written to the location at code - 7E.



Program BRANCHWRAP - Forward branch from FFxx to 00xx

Backward branches from 00xx to FFxx were already tested in TRAP16 and TRAP17.



Program MMUFETCH - 6510 code fetching while memory configuration changes

An example is the code sequence LDA #$37 : STA 1 : BRK in RAM at Axxx. Because STA 1 maps the Basic ROM, the BRK will never get executed.

addr  sequence
---------------------
A4DF  RAM-Basic-RAM
B828  RAM-Basic-RAM
EA77  RAM-Kernal-RAM
FD25  RAM-Kernal-RAM
D400  RAM-Charset-RAM
D000  RAM-IO-RAM

The sequence IO-Charset-IO is not tested because I didn't find appropriate code bytes in the Charset ROM at D000-D3FF. The SID registers at D4xx are write-only.



Program MMU - 6510 port at 00/01 bits 0-2

Display:
0/1=0-7 repeated 6 times: values stored in 0 and 1

A000     01      read/write RAM
E000     86      read Kernal, write RAM
E000     01      read/write RAM
D000/IO  3D/02   read Charset, write RAM
D000/IO  01/02   read/write RAM
D000/IO  00/03   read/write IO



Program CPUPORT - 6510 port at 00/01 bits 0-7

Display:
0/1=00/FF repeated 6 times: values stored in 0 and 1
after  00 01 
right  00 01 

The datasette may not be connected while CPUPORT is running!

If both values match, the port behaves instable. On my C64, this will only happen when a datasette is connected.

Programs IRQ and NMI - CPU interrupts within commands

An interrupt is recognized only before the last cycle of the current command.

When an IRQ occurs while SEI is executing, the IFlag on the stack will be set.




Programs CIA1TB123 and CIA2TB123 - CIA timer B 1-3 cycles after writing CRB

The cycles 1-3 after STA DD0F cannot be measured with LDA DD06 because it takes 3 cycles to decode the LDAa. Executing the STA DD0F at DD03 lets the CPU read DD06 within one cycle.
